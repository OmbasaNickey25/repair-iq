# RepairIQ: Smart Hardware Learning Assistant PWA

RepairIQ is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to help students and technicians identify computer hardware components using their device's camera. It leverages AI and Computer Vision to provide real-time identification, troubleshooting guides, and voice-narrated explanations.

## Features

- **Real-time Component Detection**: Identifying hardware like RAM, CPU, Motherboards, and peripherals using a custom-trained Deep Learning model.
- **AI-Powered Explanations**: Generates detailed descriptions and troubleshooting steps for identified components (powered by Puter.js).
- **AR Overlays**: Visual confirmation of detected components on the camera feed.
- **Voice Narration**: Text-to-speech for accessibility and hands-free learning.
- **Offline Capable**: Installable as a native app on mobile and desktop devices.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on smartphones, tablets, and computers.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Standard Web Technologies (HTML5, CSS3, ES6+ JavaScript), Service Workers (PWA), Puter.js (AI).
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js.
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow.js (Node Backend), Custom Keras Model (`.h5`).
- **Deployment**: Render (Web Service).

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Python (for `tensorflowjs_converter` during build)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repair-iq.git
    cd repair-iq
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # This will also install backend dependencies via the postinstall script
    ```

3.  **Ensure Model is Present:**
    Make sure your trained model file `hardware_model.h5` is located in the `backend/` directory.

### Running Locally

1.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This command runs `node backend/main.js`. The backend serves both the API and the frontend files.

2.  **Access the App:**
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

    *Note: For camera access on mobile devices, you must use HTTPS or `localhost`. To test on a mobile device on the same network, you may need a local tunnel (like ngrok).*

## Deployment (Render)

This project is configured for easy deployment on [Render](https://render.com).

1.  **Push to GitHub/GitLab.**
2.  **Create a New Web Service** on Render connected to your repository.
3.  **Configuration:**
    -   **Environment**: Node
    -   **Build Command**: `npm install && cd backend && npm install && pip install tensorflowjs && python -m tensorflowjs_converter --input_format keras hardware_model.h5 tfjs_model`
    -   **Start Command**: `node backend/main.js`
    
    *Alternatively, you can use the `render.yaml` Blueprint if you connect your account.*

## API Endpoints

### `POST /predict`
-   **Description**: Accepts an image file and returns the predicted hardware component.
-   **Body**: `multipart/form-data` with a file field named `image`.
-   **Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "component": "RAM Module",
      "confidence": 0.95
    }
    ```
